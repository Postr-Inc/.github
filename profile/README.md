###  Empowering Open Source Tech 

At Pascale, we're extremely proud of open source software. We believe that the world thrives when there is openness around the apps and technologies we create. We hope to be able to make a big difference—whether through inspiration or by spreading knowledge through our code and ideas—by making our software freely modifiable and usable in any number of applications.
